# Calendar

A daily schedule planner that lets the user input what their work day consists of in a block that represents each hour

Greyed out blocks represent past hours, Red blocks represent the current hour and Green blocks represent the future hours

The text input by the user is then stored to the local storage and can be recalled when the page is inspected
